## Introduction

Koordinator is a QoS based scheduling system for hybrid orchestration workloads on Kubernetes.
It aims to improve the runtime efficiency and reliability of both latency sensitive workloads and batch jobs,
simplify the complexity of resource-related configuration tuning, and increase pod deployment density to improve resource utilizations.

Koordinator enhances the kubernetes user experiences in the workload management by providing the following:

- Well-designed priority and QoS mechanism to co-locate different types of workloads in a cluster, a node.
- Allowing for resource overcommitments to achieve high resource utilizations but still satisfying the QoS guarantees by leveraging an application profiling mechanism.
- Fine-grained resource orchestration and isolation mechanism to improve the efficiency of latency-sensitive workloads and batch jobs.
- Flexible job scheduling mechanism to support workloads in specific areas, e.g., big data, AI, audio and video.
- A set of tools for monitoring, troubleshooting and operations.
